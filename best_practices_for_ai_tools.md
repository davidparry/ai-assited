## Best Practices for AI Coding Tools

### 1. Break Requests into Smaller, Focused Units of Work
- Ensure each request is clear, specific, and distinct to improve accuracy and efficiency.
- **Iterate**: If the response isnâ€™t quite right, refine the request by adjusting scope or rephrasing.

### 2. Provide Context and Use Previous Conversations
- Include relevant details and leverage prior discussions to avoid repetition and improve continuity.
- **Iterate**: Adjust context as needed to ensure relevance and precision in responses.

### 3. Use Predefined Commands to Enhance Precision
- Utilize advanced commands and structured formats when applicable for better results.
- **Iterate**: Experiment with different commands and refine inputs to achieve the best outcome.

### 4. Seek Clarifications and Explanations When Needed
- If a response is unclear or incomplete, ask follow-up questions for deeper understanding.
- **Iterate**: Keep refining questions based on responses to extract the most useful insights.
