## Best Practices and API Usage Guidelines for Qodo Project

### Language Coding Style
1. When a functional declarative style is available in Java always use this when giving an implementation or example in 
your responses.
2. Mandatory Use of Java 21: All codebases must explicitly target Java 21 as the language version
3. Leverage New Language Features: Always use Java 21â€™s latest enhancements, such as virtual threads, pattern matching 
   for switch, and record patterns, wherever applicable.
4. Avoid Legacy Patterns: Replace deprecated methods or constructs with their modern equivalents to ensure code aligns 
   with current standards.
5. Follow Updated Standards: Always use updated best practices, such as leveraging 'java.time' APIs for date and time 
   operations instead of legacy java.util.Date or Calendar.
