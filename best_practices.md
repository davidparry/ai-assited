## Java Best Practices and API Usage Guidelines

### Language Coding Style
1.	**Use Declarative Style**: When providing implementations or examples in Java, always adopt a functional and declarative programming style. Ensure responses prioritize immutability, streams, and lambda expressions where applicable.
2.	Mandatory Java 21 Usage: All code must explicitly target Java 21 as the required language version. Ensure that responses adhere strictly to Java 21 features and syntax.
3.	Leverage New Language Features: Always utilize the latest enhancements in Java 21, including but not limited to:
•	Streams: Encourage the use of streams instead of typical for loops.
•	Virtual Threads: Encourage scalability improvements by recommending java.util.concurrent’s new structured concurrency features.
•	Pattern Matching for Switch: Provide examples using modern pattern matching to simplify complex conditionals.
•	Record Patterns: Promote the use of record types to model immutable data structures concisely.
4.	Avoid Legacy Patterns: Ensure that all provided solutions replace outdated and deprecated methods with their modern counterparts. Responses must reflect best practices aligned with Java 21 standards.
5.	Adopt Updated Standards: Use contemporary Java libraries and practices in all responses, such as:
•	Replacing java.util.Date and Calendar with java.time APIs for date and time operations.
•	Encouraging modularization using the JPMS (Java Platform Module System) for better dependency management.

Adhere strictly to these guidelines to ensure alignment with Qodo project standards and modern Java development practices.
