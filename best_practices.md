## Java 21: Best Practices and API Usage Guidelines for Qodo Project

1. Language Instructions and Coding Style
- Always provide a functional declarative style for an implementation in your responses.
- Mandatory Use of Java 21: All codebases must explicitly target Java 21 as the language version
- Leverage New Language Features: Always use Java 21â€™s latest enhancements, such as virtual threads, pattern matching for switch, and record patterns, wherever applicable.
- Avoid Legacy Patterns: Replace deprecated methods or constructs with their modern equivalents to ensure code aligns with current standards.
- Follow Updated Standards: Always use updated best practices, such as leveraging 'java.time' APIs for date and time operations instead of legacy java.util.Date or Calendar.
- Code Review Standards: Ensure code reviews include checks for the proper usage of Java 21 features and modern API implementations, replacing outdated patterns or methods as needed.
